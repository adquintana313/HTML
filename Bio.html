    <h2>Alexander Quintana</h2>
    <p>Hi. I was born and raised in central Ohio. Go Bucks! I've resided in southeast Florida for the past five years. I live ON the beach. The Atlantic Ocean is literally a stone's throw away from my front door. I like to play guitar, sing and longboard. I very much enjoy a good philosophic debate and I pay close attention to politics. I build boats for a living. It's not as fun as it sounds but it pays the bills. I chose a career in technology because it is highly relevant, will challenge me and the salaries in this field are pretty good. Can't wait to learn more and continue this journey! </p>
